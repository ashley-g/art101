            <p>In my entrepreneurship classes I often have to come up with business ideas to work on for the semester. Here are some of these ideas…</p>

                <h3>Hot Spot</h3>
                <p class="date"> Posted: October 6th 2020</p>
                <p>
                    Hot Spot was an app idea I proposed in one of my classes last semester. Hot Spot is an app where you can see all the special events that are going on around you. If any bars, night clubs, restaurants, etc were having a special themed night, live music, or special happy hour deals they wanted to promote they would on the app. The app would also tell you how busy the places were at that point in time, how long the line/wait is, and how much they are charging for cover. You would no longer have to try to remember what nights of the week your favorite places had deals because you could go to the app and see all the specials for that day. 
                    <br /><br />
                    It is funny now looking back on that pre-covid time because now that is pretty much how all the establishments work here at school with an app called line leap. Line leap is a bit different than Hot Spot. But Hot Spot would have been a lot more useful today than when I first proposed the idea.

                <h3>AR Mirror</h3>
                <p class="date"> Posted: September 29th 2020</p>
                <p>
                    No thats not a cool name… its not even a name, its pretty much just a description. This is a pretty new idea that I came up with when brainstorming new ventures for class, so it hasn’t even made it to the cool name stage yet. AR, for those who don’t know, stands for augmented reality. For those who still don’t know what augmented reality is, you know the snapchat filters that put dog ears on you? and some of them have little guys that dance around and it looks like they are dancing in your apartment? Yeah that is augmented reality. So the idea for this mirror came from me trying to do my eyebrows. Sometimes it just gets so hard to shape them exactly right, you keep having to get up really close to the mirror and sometimes bend your head and arms in a weird way and then you have to step back again to see what hairs you need to pluck. It gets all disoriented and is really hard to do. What the AR mirror would do is have the technology to draw neon blue lines to outline how you want to shape your eyebrows (this would show up on the mirror of course not your face) and as you move in and out and twist around the lines in the mirror will follow you, so no matter where you are and what position you’re in you will still have those lines to guide the shape of your eyebrows.

                <h3>Queued Up</h3>
                <p class="date"> Posted: September 22nd 2020</p>
                <p>
                    Queued Up is actually an app I am working on right now. Since school has started progress has slowed down a lot because I don’t have much free time anymore. The idea came from Touch Tunes which is like the modern day juke box at bars and restaurants. You can go onto their app on your phone and request a song to be played for some amount of money (lets say 99¢) and then it will enter a queue with everyone else’s request and will eventually be played. You can even pay extra to get your song moved up in the queue. Queued Up is not for restaurants and bars though, queued up is for regular house parties, or road trips, or just hanging out with your friends. Usually how a party works is that one person is “on aux” and plays their music all night while everyone else is coming up to them asking them to play this song and that song next. I thought how much better would it be if everyone at the party could just go onto their phones and add the songs they want to the queue, then they wouldn’t have to be annoying asking the “dj” to play their songs. And the person playing the music wouldn’t have to worry about adding songs all night and can actually enjoy themselves at the party. 
                    </br></br>
                    I didn’t really think it was a great business idea for two reasons. One, I wouldn’t charge for adding a song to the queue because who would pay for that at a house party with their friends. And two, after doing some research, I am pretty sure this is already a thing, but I wanted to do it anyway just for fun and to learn some new programming skills and add another project to my portfolio. The project is linked to my GitHub account but I have kept it private for now until I have at least roughly usable and complete app.

                <h3>Suski Tiki</h3>
                <p class="date"> Posted: September 15th 2020</p>
                <p>
                    This summer I joined my cousin and her bridal party on her bachorlette party weekend in Ocean City Maryland. One of the things we did was go on a Tiki Cruise. Pretty much it was a boat that was built like a tiki bar. The crew was awesome and they even had really great speakers where we were able to play our own music. After wards I was thinking, why don’t we have this in our town? We live in a town right on the Susquehanna river. I think it would be awesome to have! I asked my cousins and they agreed that so many people would do that. I thought if I had turned 21 during the summer I would definitely do that. Or if you are having a bachelor/bachlorette party in town or any other kind of celebration. I looked up if they have anything kind of like that near by just to see if it was practical. They do have one in Pittsburg that is BYOB, which makes sense because Pennsylvania liquor license cost so much it just would not be feasible for a seasonal operation. So that is how I came up with my Suski Tiki idea which actually is still on the table! I just did not use this for my class projects because they are supposed to be technology based businesses. 
                    </br></br>
                    So maybe one day you’ll be able to book a ride on Suski Tikis!

                <h3>Smart Bowl</h3>
                <p class="date"> Posted: September 8th 2020</p>
                <p>
                    One idea I had was a smart water bowl for your dog which would track your dogs water drinking habits and notify you if there seem to be any changes. This idea came to me because of some problems my dog has been having recently with his health and the first sign of trouble was that he was drinking a lot more water than usual. Our vet told us to track how much water he was drinking, which we did with a measuring cup but we didn't really have anything to compare it to because we never measured his water intake before and all we could really do was poorly estimate it. When researching possibly ailments, it seemed like for every single sickness excessive drinking was a symptom. So thats where my idea came from. One if you had a smart bowl it would be able to track how much water your dog drinks and how quickly they drink it. Then over time if the bowl notices that your dog has had a change in water intake it can notify you early since this is a sign that something is wrong. Then if the vet ask you to track your dogs intake you will have the data of how much your dog was drinking before and how much it is drinking now. 
                    </br></br>
                    Sadly, I did not go through with using this idea in class because after doing some market and competitor research it is kind of already a thing. They have smart bowls out that do this and more. On to the next idea.
