                <h3>Smart Bowl</h3>

                    One idea I had was a smart water bowl for your dog which would track your dogs water drinking habits and notify you if there seem to be any changes. This idea came to me because of some problems my dog has been having recently with his health and the first sign of trouble was that he was drinking a lot more water than usual. Our vet told us to track how much water he was drinking, which we did with a measuring cup but we didn't really have anything to compare it to because we never measured his water intake before and all we could really do was poorly estimate it. When researching possibly ailments, it seemed like for every single sickness excessive drinking was a symptom. So thats where my idea came from. One if you had a smart bowl it would be able to track how much water your dog drinks and how quickly they drink it. Then over time if the bowl notices that your dog has had a change in water intake it can notify you early since this is a sign that something is wrong. Then if the vet ask you to track your dogs intake you will have the data of how much your dog was drinking before and how much it is drinking now. 
                    </br></br>
                    Sadly, I did not go through with using this idea in class because after doing some market and competitor research it is kind of already a thing. They have smart bowls out that do this and more. On to the next idea.
