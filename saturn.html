            <p>Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system. It is the sixth planet from the sun, 890.8 million miles away. Saturn is most famous for its visible rings around it. Even though we know it as the planet with rings, it’s actually not the only one with them. It is just the only one with rings that are visible from earth. It is named after the roman god Saturn, the titan of capitol, wealth, agriculture, liberation, and time. This god is the father of Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres, and Vesta which some of them have their own planets named after them! Saturn is referred to as a gas giant and is nine times the size of Earth. Even though it is nine times the size of Earth, Saturn’s days are only 10 hours and 33 min because of how fast the planet rotates. Saturday was named after Saturn.. maybe because of how short Saturdays feel! A year on Saturn is equal to 29 years on Earth. That means there are 11,000 Saturn days in a Saturn year! Hold on to your hats, the wind on Saturn can be 1,118 miles per hour! All of these cool facts and its fun visual features are why so many people love Saturn.</p>
            
            <h4 id='viewing'>Viewing</h4>
            <p>Saturn is viewable from Earth with the naked eye. Of the five planets viewable from Earth with the naked eye, Saturn is the furthest out of all of them. To see its rings which go around the planet, you will only need a small telescope. Every 15 years, we lose sight of Saturns rings from Earth because we are just perfectly aligned with them and they are so thin they seem to disappear. This year in the northern hemisphere Saturn will be best seen in the morning before sun rise from January to July and at night between the months of July to December.
            <br /><br />
            This year is a somewhat of a special year for viewing Saturn. On December 21, 2020, Saturn and Jupiter will be in conjunction. This is unique because this is something that only happens about every 20 years. This year they will be closer than they ever have been in about 300 years. You will be able to see both Jupiter and Saturn in the same view of your telescope, which is quite impressive!</p>
            
            <h4 id='makeup'>Make Up</h4>
            <p>The Gas Giant is mostly made up of Helium and Hydrogen. Unlike Earth, it does not have a solid surface, although some believe it may have a solid core. Because of its make up, Saturn is less dense then water. That means theoretically it would be able to float on water. It is the only planet in our solar system with this type of property.  It’s core temperature is around 21,092º F. Helium droplets rain out of Saturn which may have accumulated into a helium shell around Saturn’s core. Scientist believe rainfalls of diamonds occur within Saturn.
            <br /><br />
            Saturns famous rings are composed mostly of ice as well as some debris and dust. They also have small amounts of tholin and carbon. You may ask, where do these rings come from? There are a lot of different theories which relate to the origins of these rings. One belief is that the rings were created from the remains of one of Saturn’s moons being destroyed. Another belief is that the rings were from particles when Saturn was first created. The Phoebe ring is an interesting one. It is much further away from the planet and the other rings. It is very faint and sits at a 27º tilted angle compared to all of the other rings. The most interesting part of this ring is that it rotates in the opposite direction of all of the other rings and planet!</p>
            
            <h4 id='moons'>Moons</h4>
            <p>Saturn has a whopping 82 moons! However, only 53 of these rings have given names. There are even hundreds of more rings within its rings! Saturns largest moon is Titan. This moon, Titan, is the second largest moon in our solar system and it is even larger than Mercury! Titan makes up about 90% of the mass that orbits Saturn. The most significant part of Titan is that its the only moon in our solar system to have an atmosphere and is the only one to also have hydrocarbon lakes! That means there is a possibility that live may exist on Titan. Another spectacular moon of Saturn is the second largest, Rhea. Rhea also has its own rings, just like Saturn! Some of Saturns other principal moons include Dione, Tethys, Mimas, Enceladus, and Lapetus.
            <br /><br />
            Saturn has some special “Shepard“ moons. Two of these are Pandora and Prometheus. These Shepard moons act as barriers to prevent the spread of the rings. They keep the rings contained and confined.</p>
